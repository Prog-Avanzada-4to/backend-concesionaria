## How to run the backend

1. Make sure Java 8 or higher is installed.
2. Build the project with maven to have all dependencies.
3. Connect to a postgres database and set the connection values in the application properties.
4. Run the application.

* Extra: the application has a swagger ui to test the endpoints. The main root redirects to the swagger ui.

It's recommended to run the application with an IDE like IntelliJ. Also, you can upload it to Heroku by creating a dyno and connecting it to the repository.
